This is the beginning of a native ruby extension that exposes an api to Starcraft through BWDI.

To compile:

Have Ruby Devkit installed and ran the devkit vars bat.

Copy a checkout of the bwdi project into a directory 'bwdi' in the ext directory.

Compile the bwdi project with Debug settings and copy bwdi.lib into the ext directory and bwdi.dll into the root of the ruby project.
Run the no questions installer in the bwdi project.

In the ext directory run ruby extconf.rb && make

In the root run ruby no_ai.rb.

Run starcraft through the chaos launcher and select bwdi (deselect bwapi if it's selected) and start a game :)


Note that this is still in development, I'll accept any nice patches :P

When I feel like it I will fix the rather annoying compile process by figuring paths so that you don't have to move files around, and perhaps a nice rake file.

This project is MIT X/11 licensed.
